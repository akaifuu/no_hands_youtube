This chrome extension adds a search box at the bottom right of your YouTube page and lets you jump to a timestamp without touching your mouse.

Press control + command + p to enter the search box. Input "1" for 1 minute or "1:42" to get to 1:42. Once you press enter it also copies the timestamp into your clipboard for easy sharing. 

Install by turning on developer mode in chrome extensions tab settings & press 'Load unpacked' to upload the folder.
